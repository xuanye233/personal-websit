I am now a Master student at University of Southern California. I graduated from Zhejiang University with an undergraduate degree. I once had one-year internship experience in two departments of Bytedance. In addition, I also participated in the real-time reconstruction project of 3D human body in the STATE Key Laboratory of CAD&CG of Zhejiang University. I hope I can explore more fields of computer science and become an excellent software engineer!
